# Bitcamp Intro to HTML/CSS

Learn HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and CSS Grid by building a professional website with modern front end development techniques.

**Why Learn intro web dev?**

HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It defines the structure of a page, while CSS defines its style. HTML and CSS are the beginning of everything you need to know to make your first web page! Learn both and start creating amazing websites.

*Suggestion: Industry applications/tie-ins*

**What will the student work on?**

*The students will create a(n) X.*

*Other tutorials do x, y, z, but we want to get you up and running without shying away from the interesting components and extensions your project can have.*
