## Introduction

So in this homework we will create our own personal website.

We will start by adding a title to the website. The title tag is always in the head of our HTML files and represents the name of the tab when we open our website in a browser. We can simply add the title by inserting text between the title tags.

```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My Personal Website</title>
  </head>
```

The next thing we will do is give the heading of our name to the website. Headings tags in HTML allow the text to be processed by the browser in a large size in bold giving it a clear distinction from the rest of the text. Headings can be 6 sizes with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` being the smallest.

```html
<body>
  <h1>{Your Name}</h1>
</body>
```
