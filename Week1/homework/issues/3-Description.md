## Description

Now we will continue with our website by adding a small introduction of ourselves.
We need to differentiate this introduction with our heading so will use a paragraph tag `<p>` to give this text a smaller size and lower font-weight.

After our introduction we will also add a link of our github page to our website.
To add hyperlinks to our website, we will use the anchor tag `<a>`. The text our hyperlink is written between the anchor tags and the url of the link is added as an "href" attribute of the anchor tag.

At the end of our introduction section, we will add a horizontal rule tag, which adds a horizontal line to divide different sections of our website.

```html
<body>
  <h1>{Your Name}</h1>
  <p>{insert description here}</p>
  <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
  <hr>
</body>
```
